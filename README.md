# Mekong-Restaurant-website

I created this website for a local chinese restaurant who had a simplesite domain which was a template website. 

This made it a great project for me to work on and thought me a lot about web development. 
I used bootstrap as it was a relatively small website and I made it responsive on all screen sizes.
